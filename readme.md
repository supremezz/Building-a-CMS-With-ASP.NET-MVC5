### Tuts+ Course: Build a CMS With ASP.NET MVC5
**Instructor: Jeremy McPeak**

The best way to understand a language or platform is to build something with it, and that's exactly what we'll do in this course. You'll write a simple CMS using C# and ASP.NET MVC5, and you'll learn a lot in the process. 
We'll cover some of the features of ASP.NET MVC 5 including attribute routing, areas and custom model binding. We'll practice project organization and testing and also explore ASP.NET Identity. 

_Note: After lesson 2.3, "Adding Functionality by Testing", the tests and test project are unused and ignored for the remainder of the course. As fundamental changes are made to the PostController in later lessons, the test project will fail to build. This does not affect the main MvcCms project._
